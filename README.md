# sf-edible
Analysis of current SF restaurant health inspections.

The ipython notebook in this repository is an exercise in retrieving SF OpenData from an external web server using wget and analyzing it using pandas.  It aims to merge the most recent restaurant inspection, violation, and business information for SF restaurants.  Thus, each record in the final dataframe represents a single SF restaurant and the most current health inspection data.  The final dataframe is then used to answer questions on the cleanliness of SF restaurants.
